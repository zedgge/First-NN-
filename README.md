# First-NN-
This was my first time playing with NN of any kind, it was a learning curve, i really enjoyed it and had some fun learning about NN and basic machine learning (its just a NN that classifys images from a dataset with pytorch)

if you want to download the files go to line 92 and 93 and make sure to make the download=True for each for the first time after that you can manualy turn the download=True to download=False and your all set(a file called MNIST will automaticly download.
